## 🧠 About Me  

I'm a **mid-level software engineer** with 2+ years of professional experience (4+ years overall in development & learning).  
I specialize in **PHP**, **Node.js**, and **TypeScript**, focusing on backend development, legacy system modernization, and **cloud integrations** using AWS.  

Currently, I'm driving improvements in a large-scale educational management system serving over **100,000 users and 900+ schools**, refactoring legacy modules, and implementing modern development practices such as **SOLID**, **MVC**, and **Dockerized workflows**.  

My goal is to take on a **Tech Lead** position to continue mentoring developers and designing scalable architectures.
